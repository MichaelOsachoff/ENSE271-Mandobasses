## Project Explanation
The Regina Mandolin Orchestra is looking to update their website (www.mandolin.ca) and has requested help from the University of Regina's ENSE271 class to design an improved website. The main areas of concern that the Regina Mandolin Orchestra want to improve on are:
* Distribution of Music
* Music and Recordings Archive
* Member Logins
* Website Navigation

The goal of our group, the Mandobasses, is to attempt to improve on the areas of concern listed above. This will be done by providing design ideas, advice, and implementation for the Regina Mandolin Orchestra.
